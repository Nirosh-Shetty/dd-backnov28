neet to do
1. turnacate the location display at banner and place the refer and earn button properly
2. instead of doing somemcomplcaton to get te product price, we can just use hub price for today and preorder price for future
3. if a plan came  on a perticular session, date and location which is already there , then just push it or update to the old plan itself(Later)

how the things would work according to meal
currently it is like i'll send array of object of diffrent dates and session, on athe phonepe api.
So, we'll maintain the same api url, we can make it work for both individual payemtn or mutliple payment since anyeways we are going to send the array itself.
in the backend we need to update addfoodorder controller, that while it placing the order, just send the array of myplan id( you can even other deatils alongside), and anyway in teh addfoodorder I'm going to refer the already stored myplan data with the help of myplan id instead of relying on the fromtend given data espically for total pricce and all.

WE need the new api to update a perticular myplan like he wants to edit the quantity, delete an item, change the date, address or add new item. This also make the payemtn and order system better, allowing us direclty access the already updated backend data of my plan insetad of relying on frontend.

we are keeping showing all the myplan list to the user from today reagraless of status

how the flow would look like
user adds items to the cart for multiple dates and session which is stored in the 'cart' in localStorage -->
user clicks proceed or go to myPlan button--> all the cart data is sent to an api url ___, which adds to the myplan of the user --> during this, user is redicted to myplan page--> since we already added the myplan in the backend, we can just use useeffect to fetch the mypan data of that user and map it. -->
now user need to pay for insatnt orders(today's order) within 10mins, and can pay the other within the cutoff time. Here the user can also have a button called view myplan to see the detailas of that plan along with option to edit the qunantiy of the item, edit the addres and if he clicks on add more redirect him to checkout page/home page(yet to decide). He can pay individually(direclty redirect him to payment gateway) or select multiple dates and sessions(take him to checkout page)(Note: we need to update the checkout page, since it was taking the data from the cart, but from now we need to take the data from the myplan either by sending the array of myplan id
to the checkout page or doing something with localStorage, SO THE CHECKOUT PAGE DEPENDS ON THE MYPLAN RATHER THAN CART)(Also user edit and add items here also, so no such ui changes in CHECKOUT page). --> USER goes to pay ( either for single on or for multiple) where we give the array of plan id's in the config(if need other details also)--> payment done --> goes to addfoodorder api --> updates the myplan status and also the adds new orders for which the payemtn is done



complications

in add more
user clicks add more then he redirected to home page, now 

in location change
when user chnages the location which belongs to another hub , where the hub menu diffrerent and now the item already in teh plan is not in that hubMenu
